Use proper Markdown headers, tables, and formatting. STEP 5 - Alert Generation: If your website shows issues (status code ≠ 200 or response time > 5 seconds), send immediate alert via NOTIFYME__SEND_ME_MOBILE_NOTIFICATION with urgent status update including the specific issue detected. STEP 6 - Comprehensive Report: Send detailed uptime monitoring report via NOTIFYME__SEND_ME_EMAIL with subject 'Website Uptime Report - {{ variables['Your Website URL'] }}' including: status summary for all sites tested, performance comparison analysis with specific metrics, competitive insights and rankings, issues detected with actionable recommendations, and note that the complete professionally formatted PDF report is available for download in the app artifacts for detailed performance tracking and competitive analysis.",
